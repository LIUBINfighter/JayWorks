This is the English version of the first document. It is used to verify the i18n switching mechanism.

## What is this?
A lightweight built-in documentation system (inspired by Docusaurus) embedded inside an Obsidian plugin.

## Goals
- Render MDX content
- Provide navigation groups
- Support simple i18n via filename suffix
- Allow future extension (search, versioning)

## i18n Test
Switch language using the dropdown. If this document exists for the selected locale, it should appear; otherwise it falls back to the default Chinese version.

> Tip: Only this document has an English translation right now.
