description: Understand the goals and usage of JayWorks' built-in documentation system to quickly build a mental model.

JayWorks is a "built-in documentation + interactive demo" template for Obsidian plugin authors and end users:

- No more switching between browser and editor: core usage, examples, and reference docs are all embedded.
- Based on Markdown / MDX: write plain text or insert controlled React components.
- Clear structure: distinguish between "Guide / Reference / Developer" audiences.

## Why Built-in Documentation?

> 80% of common help and introductory information doesn't require jumping to external websites.

- Faster learning feedback: see → click → get results.
- Unified context: consistent with plugin UI / data structures (no need to re-explain).
- Offline: available without network.

## Documentation Structure

| Group | Purpose | Typical Content |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Guide | Help end users get started | Introduction, core features, diagram examples |
| Reference | Look up fixed structure information | (Placeholder) Plugin settings |
| Developer | Plugin template extension/maintenance | Rendering pipeline, navigation config, Frontmatter specs, style guide, debug records |

## Where Should I Start?

1. Browse this page to understand the positioning.
2. Open "Core Features Overview" to try interactive components.
3. Need diagrams? Check "Interactive Diagrams (Mermaid)".
4. Want to customize or extend? Go to the "Developer" group.

## Controlled Component Example

<SimpleButton label="Try clicking" />

> All components are loaded from a whitelist; docs won't execute arbitrary scripts or import statements.

## Future Plans

- Settings panel documentation (complete Reference filling).
- Search and tag filtering.
- Multilingual and versioning (introduce as needed).
