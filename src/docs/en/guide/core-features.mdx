This page summarizes the content previously scattered in `demo.mdx` and `example.mdx`, focusing on what end users care most about: what the plugin's built-in documentation view can do and what you can learn here.

## Implemented Capabilities

- Support standard Markdown syntax (headings, lists, quotes, code blocks, etc.).
- Parse frontmatter metadata (title, description, tags, update time, etc.).
- Support controlled MDX components (secure whitelist).
- Code highlighting and (future) Mermaid diagram rendering.

## Interactive Component Examples

<SimpleButton label="Click me" />
<OcrPlayground initialText="Hello" />

> Currently only supports literal properties; expressions/objects/functions are ignored (see "Developer → Rendering Pipeline").

## Typical Use Cases

| Scenario | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Quick reading of built-in help | No need to jump to external websites, offline available |
| View interactive examples | Try components directly in the docs (buttons, Playground, etc.) |
| Follow step-by-step guides | Can be extended to more detailed operation tutorials in the future |

## Next Recommended Steps

- Want to understand how rendering works? Go to "Developer → Rendering Pipeline".
