# Welcome to JayWorks Plugin

This is an MDX document example, currently demonstrating:

- Frontmatter parsing
- Basic Markdown rendering
- Placeholder descriptions for component tags that are not yet activated

## Feature Introduction (Currently Available)

- Support for Markdown syntax
- Parsing of frontmatter metadata
- Regular structures like code blocks, lists, links, etc.

## Component Placeholder Description

Below is a direct demonstration of controlled components (properties only support literals):

<SimpleButton label="Click me" />
<OcrPlayground initialText="Hello" />

> Component property expressions are still ignored; data-action string mapping will be introduced later.

## More Content

You can add more Markdown content here, including lists, links, etc.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
