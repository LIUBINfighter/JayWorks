This page is not yet written and will be supplemented when the plugin exposes formal configurable items:

Proposed content:

| Setting Key | Default Value | Description | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| (Example) enableMermaid | true | Whether to enable Mermaid rendering | When off, all ```mermaid code blocks remain as is |
| (Example) maxCodeBlockLines | 400 | Fold code blocks when exceeded | Interactive expand | 

If you're contributing configuration features, please:
1. Add type definitions in code (settings.ts / interface).
2. Ensure backward compatibility in save logic (provide default value filling).
3. Update this page and remove `draft: true`.
