description: Reference official doc style and bias points (refined from original obsidian.mdx).
updated: 2025-09-28

Follow official doc main baselines (Google Developer Style + Microsoft Style as supplement), and trim for plugin built-in doc scenarios:

## Terminology Suggestions

- Use "notes" for Markdown files.
- Use "files" for non-Markdown resources.
- Use "folders" instead of "directories".

## Interaction Descriptions

- Multi-level operation paths use: **Settings → Community plugins → Installed**.
- Avoid directional descriptions (left/right) unless necessary.

## Instruction Tone

- Titles and steps use imperative sentences ("Create config file" instead of "How to create config file").

## Images and Icons

- Prioritize SVG, then PNG.
- Control width (default display width, avoid wide scrolling).

If contributing new docs, add style difference notes here first, then split.
