title: MDX Debug Records
description: Refined problem analysis and fix summary from original mdx-component-debug.mdx.

Records the root cause of components like `<SimpleButton />` initially being downgraded to empty `<div>` and fix strategies (source doc: mdx-component-debug.mdx).

## Root Cause

`remark-rehype` did not pass through `mdxJsx*` nodes → node semantics lost → rehype-react couldn't match components → fallback to plain elements.

## Fix Key Points

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| passThrough | Add `mdxJsx*` / `mdxjsEsm` in remark-rehype |
| Custom plugin | Convert mdxJsx* to standard element nodes |
| Property whitelist | Only allow literals, boolean short attributes |
| Component whitelist | Registry exposes safe components; unknown tags ignored |

## Property Support Matrix

| Type | Supported |
| ---- | ---- |
| Strings | ✅ |
| Booleans (valueless) | ✅ |
| Numbers | As strings (pending enhancement) |
| Expressions | ❌ |
| Objects/Arrays | ❌ |

## Still in Planning

- Action string mapping (reduce function passing needs).
- Safe parsing of number/JSON properties.
- Processor caching and performance measurement.
